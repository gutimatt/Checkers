# CheckersGame
Checkers game written in java.  Allows a user to play on a console or gui application either against another player or the computer.

This application also allows a server connection to connect two players into one game to play against each other from different devices.  It also has the option to use a console interface or GUI to play locally against an opponent or the computer without connecting to the server.
